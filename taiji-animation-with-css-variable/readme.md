# Taiji Animation 

In this project, I build the Taiji animation with CSS variable. And I make it can be resized with a CSS  variable called "--radius", so I can change this variable, then the Taiji animation will scale up or down correspondingly.

### P.S.

Because I am familiar with English, so maybe I have many typos and make a mistake in English grammar. So please correct me if I am wrong in English. It really help me a lot, thanks.
